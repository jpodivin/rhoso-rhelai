# Testing RHEL AI on a single machine using nested virtualization

This repository is meant to help deploying a toy RHOSO + RHEL AI system on a
single machine.

To deploy on a single machine the OpenStack control plane will run as a single
node OpenStack inside a VM (using CRC) and the edpm node will also run as a VM
using PCI passthrough to pass the NVIDIA GPU/GPUs to the nova compute service.

Finally RHEL AI will be run as an OpenStack instance executing in the edpm
node.

This is going to have considerable performance issues because of the double
nesting virtualization, qcow2 disks, and PCI passthrough, so this is clearly
not meant for any real usage, just to help confirm that everything works as
intended.

# QuickStart

## Prerequisites

You'll need at least one [NVIDIA GPU supported by RHEL AI]() and some tools
need to be installed as well the `install_yamls` and this repository. There is
a helper make target for this, although there are some things that you still
need to do:

```bash
$ sudo dnf -y install git make
$ git clone <this repository>
$ make download_tools validate_host
```

The `validate_host` target may fail if you don't have an NVIDIA GPU, if the GPU
is being held by the graphics driver, if IOMMU is not properly configured, etc.

### Setting up the host

We have to enable IOMMU and reserve the PCI devices. These operations change
the booting command line and require generating the new GRUB configuration file
and rebooting the machine, so we recommend following modifying the grub args
for IOMMU and PCI reservation, and the recreate GRUB configuration and finally
rebooting.  That is the order we show below.

**Note:** Modifications to hypervisor PCI reservations, IOMMU etc can also be performed by the `ansible/setup_host.yml` ansible playbook.

#### IOMMU

If we are using an Intel machine, we can enable IOMMU with:

```
$ sudo grubby --update-kernel ALL --args 'intel_iommu=on iommu=pt'
```

#### Reserve PCI devices

We don't want the nvidia driver to hold our PCI devices, or they won't be
available for PCI passthrough.

There are a couple of ways to do this:

- Blacklist the driver
- Reserve the PCI devices for vfio

We can do one of them or even both  ;-)

##### Blacklist the driver

We need to write `blacklist <driver name>` in file
`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`.

Depending on the card it will be a different driver name:

- For NVIDIA GPUs:

```
$ echo -e "blacklist nouveau\nblacklist nvidia*" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

- For AMD GPUs:

```
$ echo -e "blacklist amdgpu\nblacklist radeon" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

- For Intel GPUs:

```
$ echo "blacklist i915" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

A description on how to do it on some complex blacklisting scenarios can be
found in this [RH KCS article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278).

##### VFIO reservation

So first we find the PCI devices, for example:

```
$ sudo dnf -y install pciutils
$ sudo lspci -nn | grep NVIDIA
04:00.0 3D controller [0302]: NVIDIA Corporation GA100 [A100 PCIe 40GB] [10de:20f1] (rev a1)
```

Now that we see that the device has vendor id `10de` (that's NVIDIA) and
product id `20f1` we can reserve it.

```
$ PCI="10de:20f1"
$ sudo grubby --update-kernel ALL --args "rd.driver.pre=vfio_pci vfio_pci.ids=${PCI} modules-load=vfio,vfio-pci,vfio_iommu_type1,vfio_pci_vfio_virqfd"
```

Note: If we wanted to reserve multiple PCI devices that have different product
id, we can separate them with a comma: `PCI=10de:20f1,10de:2684`

#### Rebuild GRUB cfg

Now we need to rebuild GRUB configuration file and reboot.

```
$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg
$ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg
$ sudo shutdown -r now
```

## Deploying RHOSO

Deploying OpenStack on OpenShift has 2 phases: Deploying the control plane and
deploying the edpm node.

To deploy the control plane you'll need a `pull-secret` from
`https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/create/local`. This file must exist as
`~/pull-secret`, or its location set in the `PULL_SECRET` env var.

The targets for each of these phases:

```bash
$ make deploy_controlplane
$ make deploy_edpm
```

**Note:** By default all the NVIDIA GPUs will be passed through and used by the
single RHEL AI instance.  All GPUs must be of the same model.

## Deploying RHEL AI

You'll need to create a download link in the [RHEL AI download
page](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/932), copy the link to the
qcow2 download, and pass it in the `AI_IMAGE_URL` env var or manually download
the qcow2 file as `out/rhel-ai-disk.qcow2`.

Note: You may need to [join the RHEL AI trial](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/ai/trial).

```bash
$ AI_IMAGE_URL=https://access.cdn.redhat.com/.../rhel-ai-nvidia-1.2-1728670729-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 \
  make deploy_rhel_ai
```

## Using RHEL AI

At the end of `make deploy_rhel_ai` you should have seen a message like this
one (with a different IP address):

```
Access VM with: oc rsh openstackclient ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ./rhel-ai.pem cloud-user@192.168.122.209
```

Now from your host you can run that command and you should be in the rhel-ai
machine.

It is time to proceed with the [RHEL AI configuration process](
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_ai/1.2/html/building_your_rhel_ai_environment).

And finally we can [start creating a custom LLM](
https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_ai/1.2/html/creating_a_custom_llm_using_rhel_ai).

**Note:** At least for the trial you will need to create an [Insights
activation key](https://console.redhat.com/insights/connector/activation-keys)
and activate your system with `rhc connect --organization <org id>
--activation-key <created key>`.

**Note:** There should be no need to login to the registry, as the RHEL AI VM
will have your pull-secret already set for access.

# Customization

There should be reasonable defaults, but you can still configuration a number
of things via environmental variables when calling the make targets to customize
the different phases.  This is a non-exhaustive list:

- For the control plane:
  - PULL_SECRET
  - TIMEOUT_OPERATORS
  - TIMEOUT_CTRL
  - CRC_CPUS
  - CRC_RAM: In GiB
  - CRC_DISK
  - DEPLOY_CINDER
  - CRC_VERSION
  - CRC_MONITORING_ENABLED

- For the edpm node:
  - EDPM_CPUS
  - EDPM_RAM: In GiB
  - EDPM_DISK
  - GPU_VENDOR_ID
  - GPU_PRODUCT_ID
  - TIMEOUT_EDPM
  - OCP_DOWN

- For RHEL AI
  - AI_NUM_GPUS
  - AI_VM_NAME
  - AI_CPUS
  - AI_RAM: In GiB
  - AI_DISK
  - PULL_SECRET
  - FIP_ADDR

  For example, if we have more resources, and the secret is not located on the
  home directory, you may use something like this:

  ```bash
  CRC_CPU=14 CRC_RAM=30 PULL_SECRET=../../pull-secret make deploy_controlplane
  EDPM_CPUS=30 EDPM_RAM=200 EDPM_DISK=800 make deploy_edpm
  PULL_SECRET=../../pull-secret AI_CPUS=22 AI_RAM=50 AI_DISK=650 make deploy_rhel_ai
  ```
